# Hi there, my name is Hala Elhanafy! 👋

## 🚀 About me!

I am a freshman at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, currently pursuing a bachelor in Computer Science and Information security. 

Some of my hobbies include writing, playing chess, and fashion design, which contributes to my growing interest in the intersection of fashion and technology; fashiontech.

And outside of my coursework, I am teaching myself how to code in both Python and Lua, in the hopes of creating my own game on Roblox.

## 💻 Projects:
[The legend of the yellow door] (https://replit.com/@halaelhanafy1/CSCI-271-GROUP-PROJECT) - This C++ project, created by a team of three, is a door-based game where players choose between red and blue doors. Wrong choices trigger a dice roll that moves the player backward, with a 10-door grace period to memorize the order. The game uses multiple functions to manage gameplay and Replit’s AI tools to enhance its presentation, creating a playable and slightly spooky experience.
