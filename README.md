# Hi there, my name is Hala Elhanafy! 👋

## 🚀 About me!

I am a freshman at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, currently pursuing a bachelor in Computer Science and Information security. 

Some of my hobbies include writing, playing chess, and fashion design, which contributes to my growing interest in the intersection of fashion and technology; fashiontech.

And outside of my coursework, I am teaching myself how to code in both Python and Lua, in the hopes of creating my own game on Roblox.

## 💻 Projects:
[The legend of the yellow door] (https://replit.com/@halaelhanafy1/CSCI-271-GROUP-PROJECT) - This project was made using C++ and three brilliant minds. Our goal was to create a video game that had an element of randomness, as well as seevral functions, all serving a distinct purpose. We came up with this: the player must pick between a red and blue door, and if they pick wrong, they must roll a dice, and the number they get determines how far their progress gets pushed back. For example, let's say you're at door 21, if you picked red and it turned out to be wrong, you rolled the dice and got two, you were pushed back two doors, making your progress at door 19. However, fear not! We gave the player a grace period of ten doors so they could memorize the order. We also used Replit's built in AI (as per our professor's request) to make the game look playable and gloomy. This was honestly really fun, and I can't wait to build more games!!
